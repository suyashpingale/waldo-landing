    q: "Does Waldo actually move my meetings?",
    a: "If you set it to. During onboarding you choose your autonomy level — Waldo can just tell you what it would do, suggest changes for your approval, or move things on its own. You can change this anytime.",
  },
  {
    q: "What if I don't wear my watch one day?",
    a: "Waldo works with whatever data it has. No watch today means it leans more on your calendar, tasks, and historical patterns. It's less precise, not broken.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can Waldo see my messages?",
    a: "Only the tools you connect. Waldo never reads message content — it reads metadata: volume, timing, urgency signals. Your private messages stay private.",
  },
  {
    q: "How is this different from WHOOP or Oura?",
    a: "They show you data. Waldo acts on it. WHOOP tells you your recovery is 42%. Waldo tells you your recovery is 42% and already pushed your morning meetings.",
  },
  {
    q: "What if Waldo gets it wrong?",
    a: "You undo it. One tap. Waldo learns from corrections — it gets more accurate the longer you use it. The first week is calibration. By week three, it knows your patterns better than you do.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is my health data safe?",
    a: "Your biometric data stays on-device and in your private Waldo instance. Waldo doesn't sell data, doesn't train on your data, doesn't share it with third parties. Full encryption at rest and in transit.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need an Apple Watch?",
    a: "Apple Watch is the best-supported device right now. Oura, WHOOP, Garmin, and Fitbit are supported through their APIs. An iPhone alone gives Waldo basic data (steps, screen time) but the full experience requires a wearable.",
